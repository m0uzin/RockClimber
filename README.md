Rock Climber app technical specifications

It would be a simple app, which should satisfy the following requirements:
- the user should be able to register 
- the user should be able to log in 
- the user should be able to log/save climbed routes with the geo tag of this route with the following properties
	- route name
	- latitude
	- longitude
	- grading system to be used (UIAA, )
	- difficulty 
	- length of the route 
	- climbing method (classic head, sport second, etc)
	- comment field
	- picture (later)
Later:
- from the saved routes we should make a database and at logging we should offer as autocomplete. 
	For example if a route “Paula” with geotag really close to the current location was saved by the user already, 
	with difficulty VI, and the user enters the letter P, the app should offer to autocomplete with Paula.
- offer different statistics for the user, like:
	- overall height climbed
	- hardest climbed route, 
	- longest climbed route
	- etc.
- offer climbing routes to the user


Current status:
Login, register, overview and addroute views made, still need to add the functionality behind
